        <h1>COPD Treatment</h1>
        <div class="treatment-info">
            <p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a long-term lung condition that obstructs airflow and makes it difficult to breathe. While there is no cure for COPD, treatment focuses on managing symptoms, slowing disease progression, and improving quality of life. Early intervention and a comprehensive treatment plan can significantly help in managing COPD.</p>

            <h2>üü° Medication for COPD</h2>
            <p>Medication is a cornerstone of COPD management. Different types of medication can help in reducing inflammation, relaxing the muscles around the airways, and relieving symptoms. These medications include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bronchodilators:</strong> These medications help open the airways, making it easier to breathe. They are commonly used as inhalers and come in short-acting or long-acting forms. Examples include Albuterol and Tiotropium.</li>
                <li><strong>Corticosteroids:</strong> These reduce inflammation in the lungs. They can be inhaled or taken orally, depending on the severity of the disease. Oral corticosteroids are typically used during flare-ups.</li>
                <li><strong>Combination Inhalers:</strong> Some inhalers combine bronchodilators and corticosteroids for improved symptom control, particularly for moderate to severe COPD.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphodiesterase-4 Inhibitors:</strong> Medications such as Roflumilast can help reduce inflammation and relax the airways, especially for those with chronic bronchitis.</li>
                <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> In cases of frequent respiratory infections, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat bacterial infections that complicate COPD.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üü† Oxygen Therapy</h2>
            <p>For those with severe COPD and low blood oxygen levels, oxygen therapy can be used to ensure the body gets enough oxygen. Oxygen therapy can be used for long-term management or during flare-ups, and it can be delivered through an oxygen tank or concentrator. It helps alleviate breathlessness and improve overall quality of life.</p>

            <h2>üî¥ Pulmonary Rehabilitation</h2>
            <p>Pulmonary rehabilitation is a comprehensive program that combines education, exercise training, nutrition counseling, and emotional support. It aims to improve physical endurance, reduce symptoms, and boost the quality of life for those living with COPD. This program is typically recommended for those with moderate to severe COPD.</p>

            <h2>üü¢ Lifestyle Changes</h2>
            <p>In addition to medications and therapies, making lifestyle changes is critical in managing COPD. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quit Smoking:</strong> Smoking is the leading cause of COPD, and quitting can slow disease progression and improve lung function.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain a Healthy Diet:</strong> Eating a balanced diet helps maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Exercise:</strong> Staying active can improve lung function, reduce breathlessness, and increase stamina. Cardiovascular and breathing exercises are beneficial.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Proper hydration helps thin mucus and make it easier to clear the lungs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Surgery and Advanced Treatment Options</h2>
            <p>In severe cases where other treatments have not been effective, surgical options may be considered. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS):</strong> This procedure involves removing damaged areas of the lungs to allow the remaining healthy lung tissue to function better.</li>
                <li><strong>Lung Transplant:</strong> For patients with end-stage COPD, a lung transplant may be considered, especially if other treatment options are not working.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üìû When Should You Seek Medical Help?</h2>
            <p>If you are experiencing frequent flare-ups, difficulty breathing, or a decrease in your ability to perform daily activities, it is essential to consult with your healthcare provider. Timely medical intervention can prevent further complications and improve management strategies.</p>

            <h2>üîç How Our COPD Predictor Helps</h2>
            <p>Using your medical history, genetic data, and current symptoms, our COPD prediction tool assesses the likelihood of developing severe symptoms and recommends personalized treatment options. This approach helps doctors tailor their care plans to the individual patient, improving outcomes and preventing disease progression.</p>
